# Ball-Rolling
A small game that i made while i learned Unity. It started as a tutorial, but then i developed it a bit to turn it into a gift for my girlfriend

My file is divided into two parts because i cannot upload the whole file. Just extract them into one folder and use it through Unity. Thanks!
